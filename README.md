## Introduction

This repository is provided as a convenience for pulling down and building / running all the [Docker] images that Islandora CLAW provides. 

Each image has it's own Git repository, they are included in this repository as sub-modules.

You **must** run the command ```git submodule update --init --recursive``` after cloning this repository to fetch them.

The [Docker] images can be found in the [images](/images) directory.

If your new to Docker, please read though our [overview](/docs/docker-overview.md), to get an idea of what Docker is all
about.

## Dependencies

* Docker >= 1.10.1 
* Docker Compose >= 1.6.0 (__optional__)
* Docker Machine >= 0.6.0 (__optional__)
* Vagrant >= 1.8.1 (__optional__)

There are a lot of ways you can run and manipulate Docker applications. Hence why every dependency is marked as optional, though you must pick one.

See our [install guide](docs/install-guide.md) for more information.

## Quick Start 

Assumes you have already setup and installed [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and [Docker Composer](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). If you are running this on your local machine, you may need to change the Drupal container port from 80 to 8000 in [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/Islandora-CLAW/claw-docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L74).

1. `git clone https://github.com/Islandora-CLAW/claw-docker.git`
2. `cp example.docker-compose.yml docker-compose.yml` (edit `docker-compose.yml`)
3. `cd claw-docker/commands`
4. `git submodule update --init --recursive`
5. `cd commands`
6. `./generate-env-files`
7. `sudo ./build`
8. `sudo docker-compose up`

## Usage

We provide two methods for running Islandora CLAW with Docker.

1. Single Container Application
2. Multiple Container Application

### Single Container Application

This includes all the dependencies and tools required to run Islandora in a single container (along with some developer tools).

This approach is **not** meant for production use, and has many limitations when it comes to scaling Islandora.

It's provided as a way to easily test and develop against Islandora, it's vastly easier to deploy and manipulate than the multiple container application.

Visit the [repository](https://github.com/islandora/claw-docker-all-in-one) to learn more.

### Multiple Container Application

This is the standard approach when using Docker. We split out every dependency into it's own container and then link them together at run-time. 

This is suitable for production use, and can be made to scale easily. As we can spin up any number of containers and put them behind a load-balancer container or behind caching containers, etc. 

Eventually we will add support and examples with [Docker Swarm][docker-swarm], such that we can run a large number of containers across a large number of servers. With this we could do massive ingests is on short time scales.

Please read out [Multiple Container User Guide](/docs/docker-user-guide.md) to learn more.

Also checkout our [Development Guide](/docs/docker-development.md) if you plan on doing some development work.

## Commands

For convenience a number of commands are provided in the [commands](/commands) directory.

| Command                   | Notes                                                                              |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| generate-env-files        | Generates the required enviroment files to run ```docker-compose```.               |
| build                     | Builds all the [images](/images) and tags them with the current commit and branch. |
| pull                      | Pulls down the latest version of all images.                                       |
| cache-clear               | Fixes sync issues with docker and vagrant shared folders. (boot2docker only)       |
| remove-inactive-volumes   | Deletes volumes not associated with running or stopped container.                  |
| remove-stopped-containers | Removes stopped containers.                                                        |
| remove-untagged-images    | Removes un-tagged images.                                                          |

## Kernal Issues

There are some know kernal issues that mess with the Java based images, If you experience troubles please review the and apply the provided workarounds:

## FAQ

**Question:** I get the following message ```Cannot connect to the Docker daemon. Is the docker daemon running on this host?```.

**Answer:** Check to see if the Docker VM is running, if not start it, also setup the environment ```eval $(docker-machine env default)```
